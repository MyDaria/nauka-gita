		<h1>Lot's Wife</h1>
		<p class=author>by <em>Dana Littlepage Smith</em></p>
		<p>So simple a mimstake. They say I turned to look; <br> instead it was to listen. I did not know: only the dead <br> can stand the music of the spheres made mortal.</p>
		<p>Caught in my hood, the hard chords of chaos: <br> the childish scream, the mother's litany as she names <br> the loss which instantly unnames her. </p>
		<p>And then the inconceivable: between the flint <br> blast and the crack of iron, I heard <br> the burning of the scorched moth wing,</p>
		<p>the lily as its petals crisp to white fire, <br> but more than these, the footfall <br> of a naked man who runs to nothing.</p>
		<p>And so I chose this brine, <br> now crystals shift. The salt dissolves <br> and I want to speak. </p>
		<p>Whore of all hopes, I now believe <br> some stories survive <br> in order to remake their endings.</p>
		<p></p>
